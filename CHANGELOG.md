## Pending

### New Features
* xdr: Added `LedgerCloseMetaView.LedgerHeader()`, exposing the version-resolving header accessor that already backs `LedgerSequence`, `LedgerCloseTime`, `LedgerHash`, and `PreviousLedgerHash` ([#5982](https://github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk/pull/5982))
* rpcclient: Add `Client.URL()` to expose the configured RPC server URL ([#5885](https://github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk/issues/5885))
* protocols/rpc: Add queryEvents wire types and request validation (`QueryEventsRequest`/`QueryEventsResponse`, `QueryEventsFilter`, scan statuses, typed `error.data` payloads), transcribed from the [accepted proposal](https://github.com/orgs/stellar/discussions/1872) ([#5971](https://github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk/pull/5971))

### Bug Fixes
* processors/token_transfer: Accept a `to_muxed_id` bound to `Void` in V4 event data. CAP-0067 specifies that the key is simply absent when there is no muxed destination, and that form already parsed. `Void` is what a contract emits instead if it publishes its event data as a `#[contracttype]` struct with an `Option` field — the natural way to write it before CAP-0086's sparse maps, which omit the key. Such an event previously failed to parse and was dropped from the event stream entirely, silently ([#5983](https://github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk/pull/5983))
* processors/token_transfer: Report a `to_muxed_id` of type `ScvBytes` at the length the contract emitted. It was previously copied into a fixed 32-byte buffer, so a shorter value was right-padded with zeroes and a longer one truncated, reporting a muxed id that was never emitted. Only a classic transaction memo maps to a fixed 32 bytes here; a contract may put any byte string in `to_muxed_id` ([#5984](https://github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk/issues/5984))

## [0.7.2] - 2026-08-14

### Breaking Changes
* strkey: `Decode` and `DecodeAny` now validate the payload length against the version byte per [SEP-23](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0023.md). Fixed-length keys (account ID, seed, muxed account, contract, liquidity pool, claimable balance, hashTx, hashX) must decode to their exact canonical size, and signed payloads must carry a declared payload length of 1–64 bytes matched by their zero padding. Inputs with a valid checksum but a wrong-length payload — previously accepted by `Decode`, `DecodeAny`, and every `IsValid*` helper — are now rejected. ([#5977](https://github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk/pull/5977))
  * `NewSignedPayload` rejects empty payloads, matching CAP-40 (the protocol fails such signers with `SET_OPTIONS_BAD_SIGNER`/`txMALFORMED`) and keeping `SignedPayload.Encode` output decodable.
  * Length re-checks that `Decode` now subsumes were removed from `xdr.AccountId.SetAddress`, `xdr.MuxedAccount.SetAddress`, `xdr.SignerKey.SetAddress`, `xdr.ClaimableBalanceId.DecodeFromStrkey`, `strkey.DecodeMuxedAccount`, `strkey.MuxedAccount.SetAccountID`, and txnbuild contract-address parsing. For wrong-length inputs, the xdr and txnbuild callers now return strkey's `invalid payload length` error instead of their own; the strkey muxed-account helpers keep their generic `invalid muxed account` / `invalid ed25519 public key` errors; `xdr.MuxedAccount.SetAddress` is unchanged (it rejects on encoded string length before decoding).
  * `keypair.ParseAddress` wraps every decode failure with `ErrInvalidKey`, so `errors.Is(err, ErrInvalidKey)` keeps matching wrong-length keys (and now also matches checksum/encoding failures, which previously returned the bare strkey error).
  * `DecodeSignedPayload` delegates structure validation to `Decode`; structurally invalid inputs now uniformly error with `invalid signed payload` (previously `signed payload too short: ...` or `invalid signed payload padding`).
* xdr: `Asset.LessThan` now orders assets the way the protocol does — by the raw 32-byte issuer key — instead of by base32 strkey text, and `xdr.NewPoolId` requires strictly `a < b`, rejecting reversed and identical pairs ([#5974](https://github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk/pull/5974))
* txnbuild: liquidity pool operations reject asset pairs that are not strictly ordered; see the [txnbuild changelog](./txnbuild/CHANGELOG.md) ([#5974](https://github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk/pull/5974), [#5978](https://github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk/pull/5978))

### Bug Fixes
* processors/token_transfer: trustline revocation now compares liquidity pool assets by value instead of pointer identity, fixing wrong-leg selection when burning pool shares ([#5974](https://github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk/pull/5974))
* ingest: `ApplyLedgerMetadata` now closes the datastore and the ledger backend, and returns the `PrepareRange` error instead of discarding it — an early return previously stranded one goroutine per configured worker and a failed prepare went unnoticed ([#5974](https://github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk/pull/5974))

### Updates
* go.mod: Bumped github.com/stellar/go-xdr to dc590f1, normalizing the schema bound in `mergeInputLenAndMaxSize` so a variable-length field whose length prefix ends the input keeps both its schema and input-length bounds. Every generated type decodes through this decoder ([#5974](https://github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk/pull/5974))

## [0.7.1] - 2026-08-04

### New Features
* ingest: Added `ExtractLedgerTxParts` plus `EventsFromTxParts` and `FeesFromTxParts` (**experimental**), a single-walk zero-copy extraction API that supersedes the earlier extractor bundles; see the [ingest changelog](./ingest/CHANGELOG.md) ([#5966](https://github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk/pull/5966))

### Bug Fixes
* clients/stellartoml: `GetStellarToml` validates the domain before requesting it, for parity with its sibling client ([#5970](https://github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk/pull/5970))

## [0.7.0]

### New Features
* xdr: Protocol 28 support (CAP-0083, CAP-0085). XDR regenerated from
  [stellar-xdr@9c9c1459](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-xdr/commit/9c9c145953e80990d6ff1ae3a6a973a0ce6d0694),
  the commit stellar-core 28.0.0 pins; both CAPs are ungated upstream so
  `XDR_FEATURES` is now empty.
* protocols/rpc: Add `LatestLedgerCloseTime` and `OldestLedgerCloseTime` to `GetHealthResponse`, exposing the latest and oldest ledgers' close times (unix seconds) on the `getHealth` response ([#5958](https://github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk/pull/5958))

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-09

* ingest/ledgerbackend: Added `LedgerStream` streaming ingestion API ([#5944](https://github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk/pull/5944))
* ingest/loadtest: Added stellar-core apply-load tooling ([#5940](https://github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk/pull/5940))
* apiclient: Support non-JSON responses via `ResponseType` ([#5939](https://github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk/pull/5939))

### Bug Fixes

Adds support for Protocol 26.

### New Features
* xdr: Protocol 26 support, merged from protocol-next ([#5930](https://github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk/pull/5930))
